I'm data scientist and recovering physicist. I spent the first 9 years of my career doing research and development in the field of quantitative MRI, before transitioning to machine learning and cyber security via a brief stint in marketing analytics.

I'm originally from St Albans, UK, near London, but I moved to North Carolina in 2015, followed by Oakland, CA and finally Nashville, TN. I have 3 children, Maeve, Shane, and Nora, and 3 Shih Tzus, Teddy Bear, Yogi Bear, and Boo Boo Bear. Outside of work I enjoy cooking, getting out in nature, and making the most of Nashville's reputation as Music City USA!
